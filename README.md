## About Me
Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Developer with **400+ hours** of hands-on experience in React, Node.js, Express, Django, and MongoDB. I love turning ideas into smooth, reliable websitesâ€”crafting seamless UIs, architecting rock-solid backends, and automating deployments. My retail management background taught me to listen closely to users and deliver on their needs.
